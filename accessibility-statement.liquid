                <p>Our goal is to make the Unusable Podcast accessible for everyone. Here's how we're doing that, and
                where we know we need to try harder.</p>

                <h3>Our website</h3>
                    We're aiming to meet level AA of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/">Web Content Accessibility
                        Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1</a>. These guidelines explain how to make web content
                    more accessible for people with disabilities, and user friendly for everyone.</p>
                <p>To help us to check whether we're meeting this target, we periodically run an automated check
                    from <a href="https://silktide.com/">Silktide</a>.</p>
                <p>Our shop page contains an embedded widget provided by <a href="https://www.spreadshirt.com/">Spreadshirt</a>. We're aware that this does
                not meet accessibility guidelines, but are yet to find a better alternative.</p>

                <h3>Our podcast</h3>
                <p>We do not currently offer a transcription of our podcast. This is something we would very much like to do, however we are
                yet to find a practical way to do so:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The automated transcription services we've tried are rubbish! They confuse our similar voices, and require
                        so much editing it would have been easier to manually transcribe it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We do not generate any income from the podcast, so cannot support the cost of paid transcription services.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you have a suggestion on how we could make our podcast more accessible, please get in touch.</p>

                <h3>Our videos</h3>
                <p>The Unusable Podcast videos feature transcriptions that are automatically generated by YouTube. While these are certainly not perfect,
                they offer a basic text alternative.</p>

                <h2>Let us know what you think</h2>

                <p>If would like to give us feedback about your experience with us, or have a suggestion on how we could improve, please get in touch by email <a href="mailto:podcast@theunusable.com">podcast@theunusable.com</a>.
