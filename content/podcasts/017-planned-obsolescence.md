David &amp; Andrew discuss planned obsolescence, the practice of designing products to need replacing sooner to net the manufacturer more money. Is it a devious plot to get us all to spend more &amp; pollute the environment, or just technology progressing? In our Bad Usability Nightmare, Andrew collects meat from a pub car park.

Other things we talk about:

<li>HP ink cartridges not working after time</li>
