Being forced to work from home due to coronavirus, Andrew & David discuss video chatting using Zoom & Skype, & then the rigmarole of getting things delivered. 
It gets a bit silly towards the end, because Andrew has been drinking whisky. 

Other things we talk about:
<ul>
<li>Asynchronous communication</li>
<li>Journaling on Slack</li>
<li>Privacy flaws with Zoom</li>
<li>Google Nest's camera outage</li>
<li>Unnatural delay on Hermes' chatbot</li>
<li>Comixology only has US vouchers</li>


</ul>
