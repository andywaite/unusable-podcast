Cars are transitioning rapidly from fossil fuels to being battery powered. In this rapidly growing market, UX
has the power to differentiate products and accelerate adoption. Equally, bad design has the power to put people
off switching to a greener alternative.

In this episode Andrew interviews Wolfgang Bremer, Head of Design at Elli - an EV charging brand that's part of the
Volkswagen Group.

Other things we talk about:
- David picking a new toilet
- A doctor's surgery sending an unfortunate "Merry Christmas" text message
